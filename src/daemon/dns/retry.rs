//! Unified fail-cooldown-retry policy for upstream name servers.
//!
//! Every dead-upstream path funnels through this module so failures are
//! handled consistently:
//!
//! * Per upstream ([`UpstreamState`]): consecutive failures (timeouts, send
//!   errors) mark the upstream dead for [`DNS_RETRY_COOLDOWN`] so clients fail
//!   fast with SERVFAIL instead of burning the per-request timeout on every
//!   lookup. After the cooldown one probe query is let through; a successful
//!   reply revives the upstream. A transport whose receive loop died on a fatal
//!   socket error is broken permanently — it is evicted and recreated, never
//!   probed.
//! * Per group ([`CooldownGate`]): transport-recreation attempts are throttled
//!   to at most one per [`DNS_RETRY_COOLDOWN`].
